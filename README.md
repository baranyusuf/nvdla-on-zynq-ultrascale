# NVDLA on Zynq UltraScale

This repository contains my implementation of the **NVIDIA Deep Learning Accelerator (NVDLA)** on a **Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC** platform. The goal of this project was to integrate an open-source NPU into a PSâ€“PL SoC system, adapt Linux kernel drivers to newer versions, and enable accelerated inference on FPGA-based SoCs.
